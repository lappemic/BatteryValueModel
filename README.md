## Prerequisites

The prerequisite for running this project is Python 3.6 or later. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official site: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

Follow these steps to run this project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**: You can download the project code by cloning the repository. To do this, run the following command in your command line:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/batteryValueModel.git
    ```
    Replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Set up a virtual environment**: (Optional but recommended) Virtual environments allow you to manage packages for different projects separately. This can help avoid version conflicts. You can create a new virtual environment by running:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv env
    ```
    Then activate the virtual environment:

    - On macOS and Linux:
    ```sh
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
    - On Windows:
    ```cmd
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**: This project uses Streamlit and other packages. Install them using pip:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    `requirements.txt` is a file containing a list of items to be installed using `pip install`.

4. **Run the Streamlit app**: Start the Streamlit app with this command:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

After running the Streamlit app, you should see output telling you that the app is running and giving you a URL that you can use to view the app in your browser. The URL is usually `http://localhost:8501`.
